# Docker for Development

## Installation

You need `docker` and `docker compose` installed (for MacOS just use [official app](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/)).

### Linux users

Linux users have a problem with file permissions. Files written in host volume created by root user in Docker containers are also owned by root on the host. Use Docker namespaces to map your host user to the container root.

## Provisioning

Run the following commands to prepare your Docker dev env:

```sh
$ docker compose build
$ docker compose run --rm backend bundle install
$ docker compose run --rm backend ./bin/setup
```

It builds the Docker image, installs Ruby dependencies, creates database, run migrations and seeds.

You're all set! Now you're ready to code!

## Commands

* Running the app:

```sh
# Running Rails server
$ docker compose up rails
```

* Running tests and other tools

You can spin a container to run tests:

```sh
$ RAILS_ENV=test docker compose run --rm backend bundle exec rspec
```

There is a way to run a `bash` session within a container and run commands
from inside:

```sh
$ docker compose run --rm backend
root@aef12:/app#
```

## Image Versioning

Every time you change the `Dockerfile` contents, you **must** increase the version number in the `docker compose` file using the following rules:
- Increase the patch version if a bug has been fixed
- Increase the minor version if a dependency has been added or upgraded (e.g. new Ruby version)
- Increase the major version only if the app stack has changed drastically (e.g. switched from fullstack app to API only, or from Ruby to Haskell)

## Docker Tips

**TIP #1**: Docker doesn't cleanup after itself well, so you have to do it manually.

```sh
# to monitor disk usage
docker system df

# to stop and clean application related containers
docker compose down

# and with volumes (useful to reset databases state)
docker compose down --volumes

# or even clean the whole docker system (it'll affect other applications too!)
docker system prune
```

**TIP #2**: Use `--rm` flag with `run` command to automatically destroy the
container on exit, e.g. `docker compose run --rm ruby`.

**TIP #3**: Use [`dip`](./dip.md).
